MOTRA is a flexible framework for creating testbeds tailored to the user's needs.

Its main features are its modularity and extensibility through packaging testbed components as containerized applications. Docker is the containerization solution of choice. This repository contains the sources for all available images on Dockerhub. There is a [companion](https://github.com/Laboratory-for-Safe-and-Secure-Systems/motra-setups) repository available which contains ready-to-use testbed setups that uses these images.

## Overview

This project was created so collect sources for testbed components. We needed quickly adaptable and configurable testbeds to perform specific penetration tests against different components and implementations. As we realized, there are few open-source projects available to draw from, so we decided to make ours available to the public and use the community to extend it to any domain they see fit.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The project only requires a working Docker engine. We try to use the latest version for testing our images, but it can work with older versions. Currently, we use:

```bash
docker >= 28.0
```

### Usage

After cloning the repository, you can inspect and modify the sources for creating images. The repository is organized hierarchically, which for now can be depicted as:

```bash
/
  /protocol
    /functionality
      README - contains explanation of packaged functionality
      /protocol-library
        /version
          Dockerfile
          # any other sources needed
```
We also automatically build and upload ready-to-use images to ``ghcr.io/Laboratory-for-Safe-and-Secure-Systems``. To build an image, just change into the directory with the Dockerfile you want to build and execute in a shell
```bash
docker build -t <image-name>:<image-tag> .
```

## Contributing

If you want to contribute images yourself, feel free to open pull requests. Please add a README that briefly explains what the image does and how it can be used. You can reach out to us by opening an issue.
